# Maprunner Archive of British Orienteering Records (Arbor)

The [Maprunner Archive of British Orienteering Records](https://www.maprunner.co.uk/arbor) (Arbor) includes results from all major British orienteering events dating back to around 2000. 

In May 2017 it contains 118 events with over 167,000 individual results.

The back end is written using the [Fat-Free php framework](https://fatfreeframework.com/3.6/home) with a SQLite database.

The front end is based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and uses amongst other things:

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [React-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)
* [React-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
* [React-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)
* [React-router-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios)
* [ag-grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/)
* [ag-grid-react](https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid-react)

See the Wiki for details of how to import results for new events (in case I forget).
